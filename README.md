## Overview

This project contains a collection of SQL queries used to analyze the Netflix Titles Dataset. The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as content trends, popular genres, director contributions, actor appearances, and release patterns across different years and countries.

The dataset includes information like title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country, release year, duration, and more. Using SQL, I performed various operations including filtering, aggregation, transformation, and grouping to answer specific questions about the content available on Netflix.

This project is useful for:

  > Practicing intermediate-to-advanced SQL concepts (e.g., GROUP BY, UNNEST, SPLIT_PART, CAST, subqueries)
 > Exploring real-world datasets
 > Building an analytics portfolio


## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Netflix's content catalog using SQL by answering a variety of real-world data-driven questions. This includes identifying patterns in content type, release years, genres, countries of production, durations, and key contributors such as directors and actors.

Through this analysis, the project aims to:

 Gain insights into Netflixâ€™s content distribution across years and countries.

 Understand user engagement patterns based on content types and genres.

 Apply SQL functions and techniques on a real dataset to strengthen data analysis skills.

 Demonstrate the ability to solve analytical problems using efficient SQL queries.
