##Overview
This project contains a collection of SQL queries used to analyze the Netflix Titles Dataset. The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as content trends, popular genres, director contributions, actor appearances, and release patterns across different years and countries.

The dataset includes information like title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country, release year, duration, and more. Using SQL, I performed various operations including filtering, aggregation, transformation, and grouping to answer specific questions about the content available on Netflix.

This project is useful for:

  > Practicing intermediate-to-advanced SQL concepts (e.g., GROUP BY, UNNEST, SPLIT_PART, CAST, subqueries)
 > Exploring real-world datasets
 > Building an analytics portfolio
